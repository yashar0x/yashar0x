## About

I’m a Web3 security researcher focused on deep protocol analysis and smart-contract security across a wide range of languages and ecosystems, including Rust, Go, Clarity, Vyper and Solidity.

I’m also the co-founder of [**Shred Security**](https://shredsec.xyz), where I work on securing DeFi protocols, L1/L2 infrastructure, and complex on-chain systems. My work emphasizes adversarial thinking, high-signal findings, and practical guidance that teams can actually use to harden their code.
